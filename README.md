# So what can the bot do?
- For starters, it can start converstations that feel almost surreal. All of that is thanks to OpenAI's GPT3, a popular large language model
- The bot can also respond to you messages in a Voice Chat by using ffmpeg and Google TTS
- Can perform tts for those awkard moments when you just can't get your microphone to work

  pip install -r requirements.txt

# Additional Tweaks
<!--
- To enable tts, you'll have to manually install ffmpeg by following [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows/) tutorial 
-->
- To use a custom GPT-3 engine, edit the variable in line 32 of [main.py](main.py). Replace the existing value with a model name from [here](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3)
- To create a custom fine tuned GPT-3 model, refer to [this](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) guide. Then comment line 32 and uncomment line 33 after replacing the value of variable `model` with the name of your custom model in [main.py](main.py)
